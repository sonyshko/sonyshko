- 🎌 I’m Sofia, currently studying and living in Japan.
- 👀 I’m interested in how VR/AR technologies may enhance education, particularly foreign language acquisition.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# programming for Unity and MRTK.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are related to education in VR/AR, computer-virtual agent interaction, psychological and educational side of XR, and also just interesting projects that require C#, Unity and VR knowledge.
- 🔥 Big goal: make English learning exciting for as many Japanese (and also non-Japanese) people as possible.
